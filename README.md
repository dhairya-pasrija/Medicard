# Medicard
In MediCard, we aim to keep records of patients from birth so that Doctors could access all the patients' old medical records, their allergies, and their ongoing medications in a click. In case of an emergency, random bystanders could help the victim by accessing the emergency contacts and important medical information needed for first-aid. The User could access the reports to keep a check on the current medications. The User can request appointments with the doctor and the doctor can take actions based on their schedules which will be automatically created by the app itself. Notification system to notify the user of a pending check-ups/appointments..
